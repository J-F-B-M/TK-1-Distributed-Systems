TK-1-Distributed-Systems
========================

This repository contains mainly Praxisassignments for the lecture TK1 Distributed Systems at TU Darmstadt. You may use this code as inspiration, but for obvious reasons you are neither allowed to copy and directly use it nor use easily found derivatives of it in TK1. If you need any help understanding the code, feel free to ask me.
